# Mau Theme

I created a theme based on the nord theme. The theme file was created using ChatGPT and could be modified to include more customization as it is missing some theme portions.

## How to Modify

- In order to see the changes in the theme I need to:
  - First modify the theme (`mau_theme.toml`)
  - Reload alacritty configuration by opening and closing alacritty or saving the `alacritty.toml` config file

## Notes

- I created the theme in order to synchronize the colors among the themes on neovim, alacritty and tmux
